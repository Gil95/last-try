                <p>I wasn't trying to make you stop studying to be with me, it may seem like it to you, but it's just my way of wishing you good studies and making you confident for the test</p>
                <p>I would really like you to be more open with me, to tell me a little about your day to day, I ask you for a little trust, to tell me that you are studying or busy, if you don't want to tell me what you are doing, it's your right , but I never wanted to bother you because you were busy with something else.</p>

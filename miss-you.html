            <p>But of two people who care about each other and who strive to do good to each other, learning what hurts them and what makes them happy.</p>

                Your embrace and your warmth <br>
                Of your body, of your laughter <br>
                And the way you touched me</p>
                <p>Still remembered the snow falling <br>
                From when we said goodbye <br>
                Our meeting was scheduled <br>
                In the threads that fate wove</p>
                <p>And the life that goes by <br>
                I only have memories <br>
                Our story I swear <br>
                I will never forget</p>
                <p>I should have kissed you one last time <br>
                I should have hugged you one last time <br>
                But I left you a part of me <br>
                And your eyes tell me: Te iubesc</p>
                <p>Asculta ti inima <br>
                Eu sunt prietena tá <br>
                Asculta ti inima <br>
                Inima mea inima mea <br>

                Eu sunt prietena tá <br>

                The unattainable <br>
                She's a myth that I have to believe in <br>
                All I need to make it real is one more reason <br>

            <p>That's right, I'm not sure if I love you, but I was falling in love with you, here in Brazil, we use to say that it's like a passion, a strong love but not lasting, maybe it's lasting, but I can't tell you precisely, because we met a little while ago.</p>
            <p>I've taken this weekend to think about us, and i realized that i want you with me, not necessarily as a couple, but our friendship.</p>
            <p>This song doesn't get out of my mind, i was thinking about you day and night.</p>

            eat in your hand</p>
            <p>I lost morals with the friends of the mouth <span>(mouth= he meant to drug dealers)</span> <br>
            I stayed with her and dropped the shift <span>(shift= again about drug dealing, but now it means like he used to work with them)</span><br>

            <h3>How could yu abandon i <span>(it's wrong, I know, it's a very hillbilly way of talking)</span></h3>
            <p>How could yu abandon i <br>
            If we were always heppy <br>
            That boy never deserved you <br>
            And I'm what yu always wanted</p>
            <p>That green zoio I guarantee it's a lens <span>(zoio = it's a very commom portuguese error to eyes, and he meant to a contact lens)</span> <br>
            Mine is cross-eyed but it's natural <br>
            And that volume looking from the front <br>
            It's stuffing, that's not normal.</p>
            <p>The bmw must be stolen <br>
            My belinão yu already saw me buy <span>(belina = it's a crap car</span>) <br>
            There were 15 installments that I paid late <br>
            But it only have two and I'll settle</p>
            <p>Now that I want to see <br>
            You suffer on the hand of that dummy <span>(dummy = we use to say like a dumb man)</span><br>
            I never made your pussy hurt <br>
            And his nickname is tripod</p>
            <p>If he does law, I'll do nursing <span>(here in brazil, right has this two meanings, for laws and for direction right)</span><br>
            If he fight jiu-jitsu I play dominoes <br>
            If he only drinks johnny walker whiskey <br>
            I only drink druris schincariol <span>(drury's it's a cheap brazilian whiskey and schincariol is the cheapest beer in brazil)</span></p>
            <p>If on vacation he goes to new york <br>
            Take the plane boarding and disembarking <br>
            Much better there in Caldas Novas <br>
            I want to see if there is hot water there in central park</p>
            <p>Now that I want to see <br>
            Who takes you to lunch <br>
            Coxinha esfirra and pastry <span>(popular and cheap snack in brazil)</span><br>
            And share the guarana</p>
            <p>Being without you I know I can't <br>
            you walked away and left me crying <br>
            I kiss the panties you left with me <br>
            And in my philco-histachi it's going on vando <span>(a known brazilian musician that womans use to throw theis panties on him)</span></p>
            <p>And finally, listen to what I tell you <br>
            this man wants to take advantage of'yu <span>(of'yu = of you, it's the same hillbilly way of talking)</span><br>
            Do with me accept my request <br>
            Even if it's just one night that's for us to put <span>(put= he means to fuck)</span></p>

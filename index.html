        <p>That's right, I don't love you, but I was falling in love with you, here in Brazil, we use to say that it's like a passion, a strong love but not lasting, because it only lasts a few days.</p>
        <p>I've taken this weekend to think about us, and i realized that i want you with me, not meant to be a couple, but our friendship.</p>
        <p>This song doesn't get out of my mind, i was thinking about you day and night.</p>

        <h2>Sometimes i hear you inside my head</h2>
        <p>I don't even like this song, that's not my kind of music, but you're in my head all the time singing it.</p>
        <p>I really like the way you live your life, and i've got contagious with it.</p>
        <p>i really don't want to change anything between us, but as you told me about your beloved, i'd rather be friends than nothing.</p>

        <p>Formosa, leave the house ready to dance <br>
        ready to dance <br>
        Yummy, the way I eat in your hand <span>(yummy = gostosa, "it's like hot, but you need to remember that here in brazil we use to say that we eat instead of fuck, a looooot of times)</span><br>
        eat in your hand</p>
        <p>I lost morals with the friends of the mouth <span>(mouth= he meant to drug dealers)</span> <br>
        I stayed with her and dropped the shift <span>(shift= again about drug dealing, but now it means like he used to work with them)</span><br>
        I left this crazy life <br>
        But I won't let go of her tail <span>(tail = he meant to her butt)</span></p>
        <p>I lost morals with the friends of the mouth <br>
        I stayed with her and dropped the shift <br>
        I left this crazy life <br>
        But I won't let go of her tail</p>
        <p>Go show me your tits<br>
        Raise that tail <br>
        she is already crazy <br>
        Belt wants to sit on me <span>(belt= he meant to a black belt, like a professional on it)</span><br>
        I will never say no <br>
        I will take off your clothes</p>
        <p>Go show me your tits <br>
        Raise that tail <br>
        she is already crazy <br>

        I will never say no <br>
        I will take off your clothes</p>

      <h2>I couldn't say that i love you</h2>
      <p>That's right, i don't love you, but i was falling in love to you, here in brazil, we use to say that like a passion, a strong love but not durable, since it had a few days.</p>
      <p>I've taken this weekend to think about us, and i realized that i want you with me, not meant to be a couple, but our friendship.</p>
      <p>This song doesn't get out of my mind, i was thinking about you day and night.</p>
